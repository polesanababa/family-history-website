        <p class="p">My family comes from Bungoma, Kenya. It is along the western border of Kenya.</p>
        <p class="p">A major landmark by Bungoma is Lake Victoric. It is a little bit of part of</p>
        <p class="p">Kenya and Uganda. Our family supposes that we only come from Kenya and we don't</p>
        <p class="p">know wherever else we came from.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="p"> During WWI Kenya was controled by the british people. Eventually more and </p>
            <p class="p">more Kenyans joined the goverment. Eventually the Kenyans were again in control of</p>
            <p class="p">their land in 1964. Their first president was Jomo Kenyatta and vice president was</p>
            <p class="p"> Oginga Odinga. Even though there were parts of Kenya's history that were violent</p>
            <p class="p">and chayotic, they eventually were able to keep their goverment stable.</p>
